# ShelterHelp
Platform for animal shelter organizations 


The process of adopting and saving animals scattered throughout different shelters has not been addressed, relying on old techniques such as phone calls and paper forms to document people who have an interest in adopting pets. Furthermore, the lack of communication between shelters themselves has not been addressed, with institutions having their own internal systems to rely on cross-shelter communication. More often than not, this leads to overcrowded shelters that turn to killing of animals to preserve space rather than reallocation of said animals to shelters with available capacity. ShelterHelp will provide an interface for shelters to interact with each other, serving as a centralized hub between various shelters, ultimately providing a means of communication between the shelters to avoid animal euthanasia. Furthermore, the interface will allow individuals looking to adopt a pet with a repository of up to date shelter listings and respective animal health records.
